This code is the start for post-processing the preprocessed tracking data

This is processing kinematics

Process
 - cleandata : remove left-over artifacts
 - trajectories : smooth and define curve to trajectory
 - frenet serret frame : this is relevant to equations of motion
 - moving reference frames : this is relevant to social-forces / kinetics
 - etc..

From this we can go to fish [social]-kinetics



perhaps make subfolders to make separate 'project and plotting'
