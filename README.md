# PhaseSepTracking
Algorithm for the simultaneous phase separation and particle tracking for vortex cavitation.

Based on the fish tracking algorithm developed by K. Muller (https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/kmuller1).

The present tracking code has been adjusted to high particle displacements, necessary in order to ensure that the displacement measurement is accurate. 

Requires pre-trained CNN model for vortex-cavity image segmentation
