# PhaseSepTracking
Algorithm for the simultaneous phase separation and particle tracking for vortex cavitation.

Based on the fish tracking algorithm developed by K. Muller (https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/kmuller1).

The present tracking code has been adjusted to high particle displacements, necessary in order to ensure that the displacement measurement is accurate. It has been tested on the reconstruction and tracking of particles and bubbles around a vortex cavity generated by a NACA 66(2)-415 elliptical foil.

Requires pre-trained CNN model for vortex-cavity image segmentation. The training code has been provided. It remains rudimentary (but effective), until a more comprehensive image classification procedure is implemented.
